Grim Reaper: Stop right there, young one.
John: Don’t come any closer! I’m not ready to die!
Grim Reaper: Calm down, I'm not here to take you... yet.
John: Then why show up? Just to frighten me?
Grim Reaper: Your friend, the one who died, what if I said there’s a way to get him back?
John: Why would you help me with that? You’re the Grim Reaper.
Grim Reaper: Consider it a game. I’m curious to see how far you’ll go for him. But beware, the journey is treacherous.
John: (thinking of his friend, feeling a mix of hope and suspicion) ...
Grim Reaper: I doubt you’ll take the risk. Most don’t have the nerve.
John: I’ll do anything. What’s the first step?
Grim Reaper: That's the spirit! Follow me to Shadow Gates. But remember, not all is as it seems, and not everyone can be saved.
